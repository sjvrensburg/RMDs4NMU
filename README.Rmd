AssignmentsRMD provides an R Markdown template for creating written student assignments. I uses the excellent [LaTeX exam package](https://ctan.org/pkg/exam).

## Installation

You can install the development version of AssignmentsRMD from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sjvrensburg/AssignmentsRMD")
```

In RStudio, after installation, you can create an assignment by following these simple instructions:

1. Select File > New File > R Markdown
2. Select From Template
3. Select assignment in the list of templates.

## Roadmap

Future versions my include:

- Other templates, including quizzes, slides and exams.
- Examples and a tutorial.
